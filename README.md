This is a new version of the previous application, which has some basic features.

Now we've added some new features, such as

specific course attendance for specific months

I added all semesters and all courses to my attendance.

The graph shows the top five student attendance figures at the end of the month.

This application was built with the online Android app builder tool "Kodular."
